To-Kill-A-Dragon
================

You play as Sarah, a shy - to the point of being essentially mute - girl who wants to (what else) kill a dragon. The motivation for this is the general knowledge that dragons like to hoard gold and gems. Sarah, being broke, desires gold and gems without having to actually work for it. So instead, she's going to try to kill something about twenty times bigger than she is. Yeah, doesn't make sense to me either.

The gameplay is Zelda-esque, with various spells and abilities you can use to fight your way through dungeons. Isometric view, with stylized sprites in a 3-D world.
