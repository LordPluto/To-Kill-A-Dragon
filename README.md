To-Kill-A-Dragon
================

You play as Sarah, a shy - to the point of being essentially mute - girl who wants to (what else) kill a dragon. The motivation for this is the general knowledge that dragons like to hoard gold and gems. Sarah, being broke, desires gold and gems without having to actually work for it. So instead, she's going to try to kill something about twenty times bigger than she is. Yeah, doesn't make sense to me either.

The gameplay is Zelda-esque, with various spells and abilities you can use to fight your way through dungeons. Isometric view, with stylized sprites in a 3-D world.

Controls: Arrow keys to move, Space to cast currently selected spell, Q and E to cycle through known spells.

This is the game I've been working on as a side project of sorts when not otherwise occupied with creative writing or schoolwork. I act as lead programmer - and only programmer, since this is a side project and we have no money - of the project; a friend of mine is handling the art style and design and such.

While it is obviously not finished, it's as far as we've managed to get in about two or three months' time, and everything implemented at the moment is working as designed.
